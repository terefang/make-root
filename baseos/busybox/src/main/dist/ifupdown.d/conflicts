# This scripts takes down specified network interfaces
# when connecting a new one. This is useful if you are
# able to connect to the same network through several ways,
# e.g. WLAN and wired interfaces
#
# Place in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/conflicts and symlink to
# /etc/network/if-post-down.d/conflicts
#
# example configuration:
#
# iface eth0 inet dhcp
#   conflicts wlan0
#   conflicts-replace wlan0
#
# iface wlan0 inet dhcp
#   conflicts eth0
#
# Bringing one of the interfaces up shuts down the other one.
# If eth0 is controlled by ifplugd or netplugd and taken down by
# it, wlan0 will step in and replace the network connection.
# Manually taking down the interface will not trigger this
# behaviour.
